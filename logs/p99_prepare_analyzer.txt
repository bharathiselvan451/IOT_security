[+] Analysis preparation
=================================================================
The analyzer preparation module performs essential checks and preparations to ensure successful firmware analysis.

[*] Quick check if it is a real Linux system
[+] Your firmware looks like a regular Linux system.
[*] Unique files auto detection for /logs/firmware (could take some time)
[*] Found 369 unique files.
[*] Unique binary auto detection for /logs/firmware (could take some time)
[*] Found 108 unique executables.
[*] Unique and limited file array generation for /logs/firmware (could take some time)
[*] Architecture auto detection (could take some time)
    Architecture  Count
    MIPS          108

    Endianness  Count
    Big endian          108

    Detected architecture and endianness of the firmware: MIPS / EB
