[+] Busybox vulnerability identification and verification
=================================================================
First, this module extracts the BusyBox vulnerabilities based on version details.
Second, the enabled applets are extracted from the emulation results of module s115/s116.
Finally, the already known vulnerabilities are matched against the extracted applets. Vulnerability descriptions with matching applets are rated as verified CVEs
