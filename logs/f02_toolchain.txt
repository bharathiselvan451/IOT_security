[+] Toolchain overview
=================================================================
The toolchain identification module aggregates multiple sources to help the tester in getting a better understanding of the toolchain that was used to compile/build the firmware.
For this process EMBA aggregates the following details:
    * The identified kernel version
    * Identifies the kernel release date - getting an idea on how old the used Linux kernel really is
    * EMBA extracts the GCC version from a kernel identifier string
    * EMBA extracts the GCC version from the firmware binaries
    * Uses an already identified libstdc++ for further GCC identification
    * Identifies the GCC release date - getting an idea on how old the used toolchain really is
    * EMBA extracts the binary flags from the firmware binaries

The following details will help the tester for a better understanding of the original firmware build process. Additionally, these details can support the tester during the build process of a well fitting cross-compilation toolchain.

[+] Identified kernel version 2.6.30.9 which was released on 05-Oct-2009 - no kernel configuration available.

[+] Identified GCC version gcc version 3.4.6 released on March 06, 2006 in the Linux kernel identifier string.
    Linux version 2.6.30.9 (tplink@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 3.4.6-1.3.6) #1 Mon Sep 23 15:31:05 CST 2013

[+] Identified firmware architecture MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV) / endianes big / machine configuration MIPS R3000 on binary level.

[+] Identified possible GCC version on binary level GCC (GNU) 3.3.2 / 3.3.2 released on October 17, 2003.
[+] Identified possible GCC version on binary level GCC (GNU) 3.4.6-1.3.6 / 3.4.6 released on March 06, 2006.

[+] Identified the following used binary flags:
    0x1001
    0x1007
    cpic
    mips1
    noreorder
    o32
    pic

The shown toolchain details can help in building a working buildchain for building working binaries and libraries.
Multiple examples of such a build process are collected in the EMBA wiki
