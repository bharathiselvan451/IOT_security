[+] Kernel Binary and Configuration Identifier
=================================================================
This module tries to identify the Linux kernel binary and extracts the kernel with the vmlinux-to-elf project
Additionally, it tries to extract the kernel configuration.
Based on this extraction it is possible to further analyze the kernel configuration and the kernel

[*] Unique and limited file array generation for /logs/firmware (could take some time)

[+] Possible Linux Kernel found: /logs/firmware/unblob_extracted/firmware_extract/142344-1130103.lzma_extract/lzma.uncompressed

    Linux version 2.6.30.9 (tplink@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 3.4.6-1.3.6) #1 Mon Sep 23 15:31:05 CST 2013

[*] Testing possible Linux kernel file /logs/firmware/unblob_extracted/firmware_extract/142344-1130103.lzma_extract/lzma.uncompressed with vmlinux-to-elf:
