[+] Intelligent grepit module
=================================================================
This module tries to identify interesting areas within the firmware with the tool grepit from the CRASS (code review audit script scanner) toolbox.
The grepit module name starts with a priority value between 1-9, where 1 is more interesting (low false positive rate, certainty of vulnerability) and 9 is only something you might want to have a look when you are desperately looking for vulnerabilities

There were real world bugs exploiting this issue already, think login form and comparing the hashed user password, what happens if you type in 0 as the password and brute force different usernames until a user has a hash which starts with 0E? Then there is also the question of different systems handling/doing Unicode Normalization (see for example https://gosecure.github.io/unicode-pentester-cheatsheet/ and https://www.gosecure.net/blog/2020/08/04/unicode-for-security-professionals/) or not: Bücher and Bücher is both UTF-8, but one is the character for a real Unicode u-Umlaut while the other is u[COMBINING DIAERESIS].
